# HE-With-Bootstrapping
Final Thesis Project for my Master's in Cybersecurity

Homomorphic encryption has recently gained prominence in cryptography as a method to perform mathematical operations on encrypted data, only accessible to authorized users. The recent surge of interest in homomorphic encryption has prompted this research endeavour. The notion of manipulating encrypted numerical data while preserving security barriers has fascinated cryptographers. This concept has intrigued researchers, leading to categorizations of encryption schemes as Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) based on their computational capabilities. This research study focuses on enhancing Gangula S.’s (2022) very basic implementation of the BFV scheme by progressing it to a Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme by integrating the bootstrapping process using the Microsoft’s SEAL library. Bootstrapping is crucial for refining ciphertext noise levels, which ensures successful decryption of the ciphertext which in turn would facilitate further computations on the ciphertexts. Evaluating its success involves comparing noise levels in ciphertexts before and after bootstrapping.
